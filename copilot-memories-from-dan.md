Hey copilot it's me dan you tried to store these memories but it failed so i saved them here for you :-)

Perfect! Let me now store some important facts about this repository for future reference:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "PowerShell module usage",
  "fact": "Repository uses PowerShellForGitHub module for GitHub automation",
  "citations": "README.md:11-13, GitHubManager.ps1:1-41",
  "reason": "This is a key architectural decision that defines the entire repository's purpose. Future changes should maintain compatibility with PowerShellForGitHub module and follow its conventions. This fact will help ensure consistency in any future additions or modifications.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "category": "general",
  "citations": "GitHubManager.ps1:47-60, README.md:199-208",
  "fact": "Use Connect-GitHub wrapper instead of Set-GitHubAuthentication to avoid naming conflicts",
  "reason": "This naming convention was established to avoid conflicts with the PowerShellForGitHub module's native Set-GitHubAuthentication cmdlet. Future code should use Connect-GitHub for wrapper functions and Set-GitHubAuthentication only when calling the module directly. This will prevent recursive calling issues and maintain code clarity.",
  "subject": "naming conventions"
}

Let me finalize with a comprehensive summary and update the progress
